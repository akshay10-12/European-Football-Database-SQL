# European-Football-Database-SQL

The project goes over a detailed database containing various columns pertaining to different characteristics of teams and players. In particular, the dataset is of 
the teams in Europe, along with their leagues, data about the matches played in the leagues, number of goals scored, number of matches etc. The dataset for the players
contains various attributes of a football player. 
The notebook used SQL to extract required data from the dataset that we have. We first link the jupyter notebook (in which the data analysis has been done) with the 
database by using a standard command. We then extract required data using different types of SQL queries. In particular, the important SQL commands used throughout the 
project were SELECT, FROM. JOIN, SUM, ROUND, AVG, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, HAVING, LIMIT, CASE statements and DATE commands.
